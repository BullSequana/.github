# BullSequana organization

The BullSequana GitHub organization is owned by Atos and is dedicated to the hyper computing product line. It is used to share code, documentation, and other resources with the community.

## How to publicly share an ATOS repository

Currently the organization is owned by the BDS R&D Software Factory team. If you want to share a repository with the community, you can ask the team to create a new repository in the organization or to migrate your existing repository into the organization. The team will then add you as a maintainer of the repository.
